      Intl.supportedValuesOf ( key )

      18 ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects:
        Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function
        is a built-in function object with the characteristics described in 10.3.
        Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]] internal slot of a built-in
        object initially has the value true.

        Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in
        constructor has the Function prototype object, which is the initial value
        of the expression Function.prototype (20.2.3), as the value of its
        [[Prototype]] internal slot.

        Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not
        implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in
        the description of a particular function.

    ecma_intl implementation notes:

    PHP's object model differs from JavaScript's. As a result, we aren't
    checking whether the method is a "function object" or is "extensible."
    Instead, we check to ensure the method exists on the Ecma\Intl class and
    that it is a static method.
